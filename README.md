# Introduction

This project explores the implementation and evaluation of tree-based classifiers for predicting mushroom toxicity. Decision trees and random forests were developed from scratch, incorporating various splitting and stopping criteria. The implementation includes custom classes for nodes and trees, impurity measures, and methods for hyperparameter tuning. Detailed explanations of the code structure and algorithms are provided. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using cross-validation to optimize model performance, and the models were evaluated on a mushroom dataset. Results indicate high classification accuracy. Visualizations of the decision tree and feature importance are also presented to enhance understanding.

## Data

The dataset used in this project is the [Secondary Mushroom Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/848/secondary+mushroom+dataset) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

This project presents the development and evaluation of tree-based classifiers designed to predict the toxicity of mushrooms. By implementing decision trees and random forests from scratch, the study explores various splitting and stopping criteria to achieve high classification accuracy. The models were rigorously tested on a comprehensive mushroom dataset, demonstrating exceptional performance in distinguishing between edible and poisonous species.
